# Winget-Install
Powershell scripts to install Winget Packages with SCCM/Intune (or similar) or even as standalone in system context (Inspired by [o-l-a-v](https://github.com/o-l-a-v) work)

## Install
### SCCM
- Create an application and put the "winget-install.ps1" script as sources
- For install command, put this command line:  
`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -File winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs Notepad++.Notepad++`

### Intune
- Create Intunewin with the "winget-install.ps1" script
- Create a Win32 application in Intune
- Put this command line as Install Cmd (Must call 64 bits powershell in order to work):  
`"%systemroot%\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs Notepad++.Notepad++`

### Use Winget native parameters
You can add custom parameter in your `AppIDs` argument. Don't forget to escape the quote:  
`powershell.exe -Executionpolicy Bypass -File winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs "Citrix.Workspace --override \"/silent /noreboot /includeSSON /forceinstall\""`

### Multiple apps at once
- Run this command  
`powershell.exe -Executionpolicy Bypass -Command .\winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs "7zip.7zip, Notepad++.Notepad++"`

## Detection method
- To detect an app, you can use:
`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -File winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs Notepad++.Notepad++ -Detect`
It returns `Installed!` if the AppId is detected.
If multiple AppIds are provided, it returns `Installed!` only, if all AppIds are detected.

## Uninstall
- To uninstall an app, you can use:  
`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -File winget-install.ps1 -AppIDs Notepad++.Notepad++ -Uninstall`

but most of the time, winget does not manage silent uninstall correcty.
- I would suggest to use the original application uninstaller method, something like this:  
`C:\Program Files\Notepad++\uninstall.exe /S`

## Custom (Mods)

The Mods feature allows you to run additional scripts before/when/after installing, upgrading or uninstalling an app.  
Just put the script with the App ID followed by the suffix to be considered in the Mods directory:  
`AppID-preinstall.ps1`, `AppID-upgrade.ps1`, `AppID-install.ps1`, `AppID-installed-once.ps1`, `AppID-installed.ps1`, `AppID-preuninstall.ps1`, `AppID-uninstall.ps1` or `AppID-uninstalled.ps1`  

> Example:  
> Runs before install: `AppID-preinstall.ps1`  
> Runs during install (before install check): `AppID-install.ps1`  
> Runs after install has been confirmed (one time): `AppID-installed-once.ps1`  
> Runs after install has been confirmed: `AppID-installed.ps1`  
> Runs before uninstall: `AppID-preuninstall.ps1`  
> Runs during uninstall (before uninstall check): `AppID-uninstall.ps1`  
> Runs after uninstall has been confirmed: `AppID-uninstalled.ps1`  

If your using WAU (Winget-AutoUpdate) `AppID-preinstall.ps1`, `AppID-install.ps1`, `AppID-upgrade.ps1` and `AppID-installed.ps1` get copied to the WAU mods directory and runs when upgrading apps.  

`AppID-installed-once.ps1` runs instead of `AppID-installed.ps1` from Winget-Install and doesn't get copied to the WAU mods directory.  

They are deleted from WAU on an uninstall (if not externally managed).
